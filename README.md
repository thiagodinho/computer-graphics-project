<h2>Project presented for the conclusion of the Graphics Computing component. For this project, CodeBlocks was used with the assistance of Glaux.h. The requirements set by the professor for the project were as follows:</h2>

<h4>☑️ Replace the square with a circle.</h4>
<h4>☑️ Each time the circle touches the screen boundaries, change the colors used.</h4>
<h4>☑️ When the object touches the top or bottom of the screen, change the shape or size of the object. When the object touches the left or right side of the screen, change the shape or size of the object again.</h4>
<h4>☑️ Implement two rectangles (referred to as cursors), in which the user can move up or down (using the corresponding keys). Challenge: When the moving object touches this cursor, make it bounce (change direction), as it does with the other corners of the screen. Reduce the main object so that it is smaller and proportional to the cursor that was created.</h4>
<h4>☑️ Add lighting and texture to the modeling to be performed.</h4>
<h4>☑️ The project must have additional implementations in the modeling (at least 5 distinct features/resources) that increase the quality and functionality of the game, and the group must propose these modifications to the professor for approval. The group must make a partial delivery with a brief report on what will be done and which functionalities will be implemented, and later make the final delivery of the implementation.</h4>
